My name is Xutong Liu. I am now a postdoctoral fellow working with [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) at the [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honered rank (top 5%) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017.

Research
======
My research focuses on **data-driven/online combinatorial optimization**, an intersection of combinatorial optimization, stochastic modeling, online learning, and reinforcement learning. Through the lens of algorithm design and mathematical tools, I am interested in decision-making applications for recommender systems, network systems, quantum systems, and data-center optimization. For these applications, my goal is to develop efficient solutions with provable **learning efficiency**, **scalability**, and **generalizability** guarantee. 

My recent works mainly study the online learning and the reinforcement learning problems, e.g., **combinatorial multi-armed bandits**, **distributed/federated multi-armed bandits**, and **reinforcement learning with large action spaces**.
