My name is Xutong Liu. I am now a postdoctoral fellow working with [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) (IEEE/ACM Fellow) at the [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at CUHK in 2022, proudly supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honered rank (top 5%) from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017. For the research, I am fortunate to collaborate with many outstanding researchers, including [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) (IEEE Fellow, Chair of [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msr-asia-theory-center/)), [Dr. Siwei Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/siweiwang/) from Microsoft Research, [Prof. Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, [Dr. Jinhang Zuo](https://jhzuo.github.io/), Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/hajiesmaili-mohammad), Prof. [Don Towsley](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/towsley_donald) (IEEE/ACM Fellow) from University of Massachusetts Amherst, [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/) from Carnegie Mellon University, and Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) from California Institute of Technology.

Research
======
My research focuses on **data-driven combinatorial optimization** and **combinatorial optimization under uncertainty**, which are intersections of combinatorial optimization, stochastic modeling, online learning, and reinforcement learning. Through the lens of algorithm design and mathematical tools, I am interested in solving decision-making problems for recommender systems, network systems, and data-center optimization. For these applications, my goal is to develop efficient solutions with provable learning efficiency, scalability, and generalizability guarantee. 

My recent works mainly study the online learning and the reinforcement learning problems, e.g., **combinatorial multi-armed bandits**, **distributed/federated multi-armed bandits**, and **reinforcement learning with large action space**.
