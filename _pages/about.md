My name is Xutong Liu. I am now a postdoctoral fellow working with [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) at the [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honered rank (top 5% students) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017.

Research
======
My research focuses on data-driven/online combinatorial optimization, an intersection of combinatorial optimization, stochastic modeling, online learning, and reinforcement learning. Through the lens of algorithm design and mathematical tools, I develop efficient solutions for decision-making applications in recommender systems, network systems, quantum systems, and data-center optimization, with provable learning efficiency, scalability, and generalizability guarantee. My recent projects mainly study online learning and reinforcement learning problems, e.g., combinatorial multi-armed bandits, distributed/federated multi-armed bandits, and reinforcement learning with large action spaces.

News
======
- **Sept. 2022**: Our work on batch-size independent regret bounds for combinatorial bandits is accepted to NeurIPS 2022.
- **July. 2022**: I successfully defend my Ph.D. thesis! I will join CUHK as a postdoc this fall.
