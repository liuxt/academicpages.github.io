My name is Xutong Liu. I am now a postdoctoral fellow working with [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) at the [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at CUHK in 2022, supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honered rank (top 5%) from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017. For my research, I spend enjoyable time working with [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/), [Dr. Siwei Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/siweiwang/) from Microsoft Research, [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/), [Dr. Jinhang Zuo](https://jhzuo.github.io/) from Carnegie Mellon University, and [Prof. Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/) from Shanghai Jiaotong University.

Research
======
My research focuses on **data-driven/online combinatorial optimization**, an intersection of combinatorial optimization, stochastic modeling, online learning, and reinforcement learning. I am interested in studying decision-making problems for recommender systems, network systems, quantum systems, and data-center optimization. Through the lens of algorithm design and mathematical tools, my goal is to develop efficient solutions with provable learning efficiency, scalability, and generalizability guarantee for above applications. 

My recent works mainly study the online learning and the reinforcement learning problems, e.g., **combinatorial multi-armed bandits**, **distributed/federated multi-armed bandits**, and **reinforcement learning with large action space**.
