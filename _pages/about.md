Hi, my name is Xutong Liu. I am now a postdoctoral researcher in [LIONS research group](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/), in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/). Previously, I was a visiting postdoc in [SOLAR Lab](https://solar.cs.umass.edu/people.html) at University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/), and a postdoctoral fellow in [ANSR Lab](http://ansrlab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/)  at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/) (IEEE/ACM Fellow). 
I received my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at CUHK in 2022, proudly supervised by [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/). Prior to that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with an honored rank (top 5%) from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017. 

**I am actively seeking faculty or research-focused positions starting in Fall 2025**. Here are my [CV](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/1155098137_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EW0a2sUstBhEv3bAMyvivggBy2VvBYC_Aba0_ErOMFrCYg?e=efYRkT) and my [research statement](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/1155098137_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EfLrmkWPK0BGpOdJZqJbN8sBitPgYVARURsmWkzRZz5qHw?e=OfwDI3).

My Research
======
My research strives to develop **scalable, generalizable, and robust machine learning algorithms** for **AI-powered networked systems**. In light of this vision, I focus on **theoretical foundations** of combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty, federated online learning, reinforcement learning with large action spaces, and their **applications** in edge/cloud computing systems, multimedia networks, smart energy systems, and LLM serving systems.

For my research, I am fortunate to collaborate with many outstanding researchers, including [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/) (IEEE Fellow, Chair of [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msr-asia-theory-center/)), [Dr. Siwei Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/siweiwang/) from Microsoft Research, [Prof. Jinhang Zuo](https://jhzuo.github.io/) from City University of Hong Kong, [Prof. Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, [Prof. Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/) (IEEE Fellow), [Prof. Defu Lian](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/liandefu), [Prof. Hong Xie](https://hongxie.github.io/) from University of Science and Technology of China, Prof. [Don Towsley](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/towsley_donald) (IEEE/ACM Fellow), [Dr. Xuchuang Wang](https://xuchuangw.com/) from University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) from California Institute of Technology. 

I am always open to new research collaborations with both industry and academia. Please contact me if you are interested!
