My personal notes on writing. Keep updating...

This is a quick summary of Prof. Baochun Li's talk [How to Write Perfect Papers](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18v411n7mr?share_source=copy_web). Another sharing of [writing tips](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/1155098137_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EceRe6XzicRNsenQ0NxkVqIBWtw1reTR1epd6cbGQ3vmqg?e=esyZaI) is also quite useful, will summarize that later.

# Writing Perfect Papers

# Story

1. It’s a bout how we advance the state of the art.
    1. What is the problem.
        1. Following the trend? Could be incremental.
        2. Contrarian, against the trend
    2. What’s new.
        1. First, briefly introduce the state-of-the-art in the literature, solving the same problem you wish to solve.
        2. Talk about  what is new in your work.
        3. If the problem is **different from previous work - different assumptions for example,** provide justifications why this assumption is important and necessary.
    3. How is it better.
        1. theoretical properties or better experimental results.

# Work

1. Read
    1. Become an expert on the problem we want to solve.
    2. How?
        1. Start from a single paper.
        2. Do a expanded-ring search: BFS
            1. cite, cited, same authors
2. Write
    1. write about what you understood
    2. write every day
    3. writing is the best way to force yourself to **think clearly** and be **focused**
    4. idea⇒write a paper⇒do research
        1. write related works ⇒ what’s new
        2. write what’s challenging.
        3. write why the problem is important
        4. write what needs to be fixed
    5. Crystallized that you don’t quite understand yet
    6. Writing opens a dialogue, for others to read what you wrote.

# Art

1. Pay attention to the title, abstract, intro, and flow of the ideas
    1. Title, 2 line, 10000 readers
        1. as simple and short as possible
        2. the one that is the easiest to understand at a glance 
        3. E.g., local sgd converges fast and communicates little.
2. Abstract.
    1. One sentence to state the background.
    2. One sentence to state ⇒ **what the problem is?**
    3. Two to four sentences to state the original contributions in the paper⇒**what’s new**
    4. One sentence to state **how the solution is better**, validated using analyses, simulations or experiments.
3. Intro
    1. Self contained: do not need to read the rest of the paper.
    2. Be clear on what the problem is, why our solution is new and how it’s better.
    3. Don’t do…
        1. Too long.
        2. spend too much space on the background and related work.
        3. Don’t boost the contribution.
    4. Structure
        1. First paragraph: a general overview of the research field, warm up the reader and to prepare for the problem statement, 2-3 sentences.  
        2. 1-2 paras, state the problem and existing solutions
        3. limitations of existing solutions that motivate this paper.
        4. Proposed solution: high level idea
    5. What’s new
        1. why is the proposed solution different from and better than existing solutions?
        2. 1-2 most impressive highlights.
        3. Make the originality of the paper crystal clear and stand out
    6.  Hey, if they can really deliver this, that will be very exciting. I will read the rest of the paper.
    7. Include a **table.**
    8. Use examples: how main idea works in a special case.
4. Flow of ideas
    1. One paragraph contains one complete idea.
5. General rules of thumb for the length
    1. abstr 200 words
    2. intro 1 page
    3. related work half a page

# Details

1. Git: track all histories
2. Eliminate grammar and typos
3. **Transitional words,** 
    1. Two half sentences, **as since, or else**
    2. Two sentences. 
        1. However, In addition, Further, Nevertheless, Fortunately, Unfortunately, Surprisingly. 
        2. To make matters worse, to further exacerbate the problem the bad news is
        3. The implications are two-fold, It turns out that, As an example, to take … a step further
    3. Sections and paras: It only remains to see …, The simple anser to this question is, the only challenge that remains now is, to address this challenge, we first present, next, we evaluate, we are now ready to.
4. Don’t use long sentences
5. Don’t be too colloquial, too formal, or too emotional
6. Counts and uncounts
    1. A few, a number of, fewer
    2. less, lower 
7. Oxford Dictionary of English, Thesaurus
8. Typeset your paper correctly and beautifully
9. draw.io
