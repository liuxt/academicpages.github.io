My personal notes on presentation & meeting. Keep updating...

The following is a quick summary of Prof. Baochun Li's talk [The Art of Presentation](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PM4y1P7N3?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0). 

# The Art of Presentations

# Motivation

When most people cannot give good presentations, you can stand out and take advantage!

# Preparation

1. You should be very excited about your work, be enthusiastic.
    1. Use **hand gestures.**
    2. Use **maximum power** in voice and a microphone.
    3. **Avoid** a tone that feels **boring**.

**Three tips**

1. Keep it simple (KIS).
    1. Your audience needs to see the **big picture**. (This is something for the audience to remember).
    2. Answer two questions:
        1. **What’s my point**.
        2. **Why does it matter**.
    3. Design your **take away message.** 
        1. Why? Presentation is like filling water into a plastic bottle (that only has a narrow neck) — **don’t pour too much too quickly**.
        2. If you want to go **deeper**, **reduce** your scope.
        3. If you want to cover **more**, be **less** technical.
2. Work hard on the **flow of ideas.**
    1. Organize how to deliver the take away message.
3. Practice your presentation.
    1. It is a performance show — every performance show needs rehearsal. The practice only makes your presentation better
        1. First in your mid.
        2. Then out loud to yourself.
        3. In front of a friendly audience (like a research group).
        4. Get feedback and improve your talk.

# Design

1 min of talk ⇒ 50 mins design.

**Two tips about design**

1. You are the boss, not the slides. Your slides are your assistants.
    1. Most speakers include **all** the information they are going to talk about in the slides.
2. Keep your slides simple.
    1. Have plenty of empty space.
    2. Don’t use bullets. **If you have bullets, show them one at a time. (make your audience nervous)**
    3. Use huge sans serif fonts.
    4. Use photos and graphics. 
    5. Use **builds and overlays**.

# Deliver

1. Open and close your talk well.
    1. Like chess, **good opening** is critical— it draws **attention**.
    2. The audience is most alert during the **first several mininutes** of your talk, **use it wisely**
    3. Straight to your message as soon as you open
    4. Closing is like gymnastics, **never rush**. Repeating take away messages.
2. Control the pace very very well.
    1. Slow down — the one-way communication channel from you to the audience is **lossy**. If you speed up, everything will be lost. Warm up phases.
    2. Be on time — Know how much time you have left. You have to close **right on time**!
    3. Use a remote control with only the **forward** button. **Never** revisit past slides.
3. Connect with the audience
    1. Talk to the audience.
    2. Make eye contact.
    3. Use gestures.
    4. Move away from the podium.
